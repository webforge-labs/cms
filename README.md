# cms

this is a testable body of a cms installation.

The "core" of the cms is in the Webforge\CmsBundle (located in `src\php\Webforge\CmsBundle`). The cms consists of this bundle and some components (see `src\php`).

## versioning

The npm package webforge-cms and the composer package webforge/cms will be always in sync in versioning. So some minor changes may only apply to the js package, to the php-package or to both of them.

## testing

phpunit
